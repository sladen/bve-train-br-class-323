This package was Debianised by Paul Sladen <ubuntu@paul.sladen.org>
on 2009-02-19 15:28 +0000

It was downloaded from:
  http://www.trainsimcentral.co.uk/bve_train.htm

  Following discussion with the authors, an extra upstream release
  was specially prepared by the upstream authors, including the updated
  Readme.  Two sounds were replaced with free-er versions and some other
  Motor*.wav sounds were removed and replaced with silent sounds of
  equivalent length.

Upstream authors:
  Steve Green
  Anthony Bowden <anthony-b@railsimroutes.net>
  Steve Thomas

  Some of the .wav sounds contain a misleading "copyright" string
  embedded in the RIFF metadata.  This string is advertising the
  MS Windows-based software that was used during editing of the sounds
  and does not appear to relate to the sounds themselves.
