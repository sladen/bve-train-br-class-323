bve-train-br-class-323 (4.0.1809-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * This package will probably be modularised in future to produce
    multiple binary packages, once the extent of overlap with other
    trains/route data is understood.
  * Initial release (LP: #331188) (LP: #356615)
  * Recode .wav files to Ogg Vorbis to save space.  Inline rename
    them (as .wav) for the moment as some filenames are hardcoded.
  * Rename source-package-name to match binary-package-name
  * Include pseudo 'watch' file
